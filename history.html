        <h2>The History of the depletion of Ozone?</h2>
        <p>They knew that if they found UV(b) light, then there would have been a disturbance in the substance that was preventing this type of light. This is what concluded. So, in 1976, CFC’s or Chlorofluorocarbons was discovered. This was very useful, and many desirable characteristics like it was not poisonous, durable, didn’t react with most things in general. It was used in AC’s, refrigerators, asthma medicine, hair spray and a lot of other objects we use on a daily basis. Then, then they found that these CFC’s were in some way or another related to the Ozone layer, but had no scientific basis, no proof. But U.S.A had banned Aerosol (Used to contain CFC’s), an early step, especially without proof. Though the European Union did not agree. One Researcher was asked to sort out the Raw Data of the Ozone in the Antarctic Region. He found out that the Ozone had started depleting showing that the ozone present, was least in spring. That same year NASA’s had published papers from space, proving the depletion of Ozone in the Stratosphere.</p>
