        <h2>What is ozone?</h2>
        <p>
            Ozone is a poisonous gas, found in the <em> stratosphere </em>.  It contains 3 oxygen atoms, discovered in 1839, by its smell. Named after the Greek word, “Ozien”.

        <h2>What is the Stratosphere?</h2>
        <p>The Stratosphere is the 2nd layer of the atmosphere. There are 5 layers of atmosphere. They are <br>
            
             Troposphere <br>
             Stratosphere <br>
             Mesosphere <br>
             Thermosphere <br>
             Exosphere <br>

            You can include Thermosphere if u want to. The Ozonosphere, also known as the Ozone layer is found in the Stratosphere, the second layer of the atmosphere.

        <h2>Who founded the Ozone Layer?</h2>
        <p>Charles Farby and Henri Buisson, French physicists had discovered it in 1913. The experiment took place wanting to find out the whole spectrum of light, as we can’t see all of it. We can only see 380-700 nanometers. We can’t see like radio waves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma Rays.
            Seeing the results, they were surprised that there was no UV(b) light. So they came to a conclusion that there was a substance that was present to prevent UV(b) light from entering the Earth. Till then Ozone was just some substance found in Chemistry textbooks. They found this very interesting, as this type of light can cause <em>Cancer </em>, <em>Sunburns</em>. And had found what is known today as the Ozone Layer.
