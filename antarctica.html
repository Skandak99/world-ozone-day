        <h2>Why is it damaged in Antarctica? Why Antarctica?</h2>
        <p>So, above Antarctica there are these clouds called Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC’s), they are contained by the jet stream and the strength of the jet streams. The strength of the jet streams loosens around every 5 years. The effect will devastating for the surrounding area.
            <br><br>
            Without PSC’s
            <br>
            Chlorine Monoxide + Nitrogen Dioxide ----> Harmless without UV radiation
            <br>
            ClO + NO<sub>2</sub> ----> ClONO<sub>2</sub>
            <br>
            This substance is relatively harmless.
            <br><br>
            With PSC’s
            <br>
            ClONO<sub>2</sub> + HCl -----> Cl<sub>2</sub> + HNO<sub>3</sub>
            <br><br>
            HCl is found in the PSC’s which is why the depletion of the ozone levels is so drastic in Antarctica.
            And the Chlorine molecule, had already shown its power, 1 chlorine atom destroying 10,000 Ozone molecules.
