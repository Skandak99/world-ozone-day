        <h2> The Chemistry behind this?</h2>
        <p>
            So, in the stratosphere, or the ozonosphere, there is a continuous reaction happening. 
Like One Oxygen atom and one ozone molecule will combine to form 2 oxygen molecules. <br>
O<sub>3</sub> + O -----> 2O<sub>2</sub> <br>
O<sub>3</sub> + O <----- 2O<sub>2</sub> <br> <br>
There will always be a balance between the Ozone and Oxygen molecules, with no disturbance from humans. When the UV radiation comes into contact with the CFC’c, a chlorine molecule is separated from it. But when the free chlorine molecules come into play it’s a totally story. It looks something like this. <br>
O<sub>3</sub> + Chlorine ---> Chlorine Monoxide + O<sub>2</sub>
O + Chlorine Monoxide ---> O<sub>2</sub> + A free Chlorine molecule <br>
So, one chlorine molecule can cause literally unlimited damage, but in Antarctica it amplifies the damage multifold.
So the Ozone and oxygen atoms to Oxygen molecule will look like this <br>
This will make the reaction look like this <br>
O<sub>3</sub> + O -----> 2O<sub>2</sub> <br>
O<sub>3</sub> + O <-------------- 2O<sub>2</sub>
